# Chat with MySQL Project

Welcome to the Chat with MySQL project! This repository contains a project that leverages the LangChain framework and the Mistral 7B instruct model to enable natural language interactions with a MySQL database. The database used in this project is the Chinook database, which is a sample database available for learning and experimentation.

## Introduction

The Chat with MySQL project aims to simplify interactions with relational databases by allowing users to query and manipulate the database using natural language. This is achieved using LangChain, a framework used for building applications with LLMs, in combination with the Mistral 7B instruct model, which provides robust natural language understanding capabilities.


## Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Interact with the Chinook database using plain English queries.
- **Flexible and Extensible**: Built with LangChain, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- **Sample Database**: Uses the Chinook database, which includes tables such as `Artist`, `Album`, `Track`, `Invoice`, and more.
